## What is short deck?

Short deck hold'em is a version of Texas hold'em where the cards below 6 are removed from the deck. This results in a 36 card deck with a lot more action and different hand rankings (flush beats full house and trips beats straight--in some versions). As the pool of players in Texas Hold'em is becoming dominated by online experts, the game is losing popularity among the amateur. Short deck is designed to have a lot more action and variance so it is rising to fill the gap. The new game hasn't been figured out until now!
